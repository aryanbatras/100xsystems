# LLM API Integration with Streaming

This is where we connect our agent to an actual LLM. We'll build a client that handles streaming responses, manages message history, calculates token usage, and handles API errors gracefully.

(Full lesson content continues — see the original 01-lesson-llm-integration.md for complete content)

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `src/llm/client.ts` sends requests to the LLM API
- [ ] Streaming mode shows tokens in real-time
- [ ] Non-streaming mode returns complete response
- [ ] API errors are caught and reported gracefully
- [ ] Mock mode works without API key (for development)
- [ ] Context manager tracks token usage
- [ ] `npm run build` passes without errors
